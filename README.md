# drag-rectangles - Crown

Entrance:
app/index.html

Dependencies:
angularJs
jQuery

Features:
- rectangles are draggable
- show overlapped area in green
- show value of overlapped area

In real integrated, three things listed below would be different and not limited to those:
- Version Control:
	mulitple people or multiple teams would share one or more remote branches, which might cause code confilcts and require further branch mangement.
- Testing:
	other than manual testing, front-end unit test and end-to-end test is demanded.
- Minification resources:
	minified resources will optimize file requests and quicken page load times on production. Compliers normally will reduce size of javascript/css file and merge multiple scripts files in one file for client download, etc.
(others: feature requirements will have more complex behaviours and modules will have dependencies to deal with)
